Hello, there. Welcome to my personal webpage playground. Here you can find my personal webpage source file including some css and javascript files. You can access my personal website on: https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~z274chen/index.html.
Please be noted everything in my GitLab you can see are totally visible for everyone. Please make sure you notify me before you want to do any redistribution of those codes.
Again, thanks for being here and have fun playing in my playground. If you find any bug or feel interested in more little projects, please do not hesitate to contact with me!

Survive Strive Thrive
Best Regards,
Zheng Chen
